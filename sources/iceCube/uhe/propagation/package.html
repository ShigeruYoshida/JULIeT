    <h1>Package icecube.uhe.propagation</h1>

<P>
      This package contains the classes to calculate
the particle(neutrinos, muons, and tauons) propagation in the Earth. 
Energy distribution and its (relative) intensities of Nu-e, Nu-Mu, Nu-tau,
mu, and tau for a given trajectory are calculated by the methods
in the class <b>PropagationMatrix</b>. The calculation method
is not based on the Monte Carlo, but numerical calculation
of the transport equation by building the propagation matrices,
which gives more accurate results with less CPU time.
The propagation matrices are build by the interaction and decay matrices
generated by <b>InteractionsMatrix</b> in the package icecube.uhe.interactions
and <b>MuDecayMatrix</b>, <b>TauDecayMatrix</b> in icecube.uhe.decay.
As explained in the package document of interactions, the interaction
matrices should be pre-calculated and readable by <b>PropagationMatrix</b>.

<P>
<b>RunPropagationMatrix</b> runs the <b>PropagationMatrix</b> for
actual calculations. It uses several methods in <b>PropagationMatrix</b>
to save CPU time for calculating particle energy distribution
during the long travel in the Earth. You can submit the calculation
job by <b>MainRUN</b> which has the <b>main</b> Method.

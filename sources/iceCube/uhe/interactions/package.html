    <h1>Package icecube.uhe.interactions</h1>

<P>
      This package deals with all kind of interactions
involving elemetary particles such as charged leptons and neutrinos.
The Key classes are <b>Interactions</b> and <b>InteractionsMatrix</b>.

<P>
The class <b>Interactions</b> is the abstract class to provide the methods
to calculate differential cross section, total cross section,
inelasticity, etc. The individual interaction class like 
<b>PairCreation</b> is a child class of <b>Interactions</b>.

<P>
You find the classes of "interaction name" + "Fit" like
<b>PairCreationFit</b>. They have been prepared for saving
CPU time because cross sections in a few interactions
require intensive calculations and would not be so practical
if you calculate the relevant numbers in real-time manner.
Instead the <b>InteractionFit</b> classes read out
the pre-calculated differential cross section table
(<it>to be accurate</it>, y/E x dSigma/dy)
from the file and interpolates them to give a differential
cross section and to give a total cross section by numerical
integration. The cross section table can be generated
by the class of "Make" + "interaction name" + "Table"
like <b>MakePairCreationTable</b>.

<P>
The <b>InteractionsMatrix</b> class calculates
the interaction matrices consisting of the differential
cross sections dSigma/dlogE_j(log E_i) and sigma(log E_i).
The integer iLogE is an index of the matrix and
<pre>

log E =  Particle.getDeltaLogEnergy() x iLogE +  Particle.getLogEnergyMinimum()

</pre>
gives the energy. The defaults values defined by the <b>Particle</b>
class in the package icecube.uhe.particles are
<pre>

log E[GeV] =  0.01 x iLogE +  6.0

</pre>
and iLogE &lt 600. 

The each interactionMatrix objects are generated, serialized, and out-streamed
in the disk by "Make" + "interaction name" + "Mtx" like 
<b>MakeBremsstrahlungMtx</b>. These out-streamed objects will be used
for later work like calculating particle propagation in earth
performed by the classes in the package icecube.uhe.propagation.

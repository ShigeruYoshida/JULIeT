    <h1>Package icecube.uhe.event</h1>

<P>
      This package contains the classes to generate
Monte Carlo events of neutrino/muon/tau tracks
propagating in rock/ice. The <b>Event</b> class
defines the event behavior
providing the methods to determine where and which 
interaction/decay takes place and to return
the recoiling energy from the interaction/decay.
<b>JulietEventGenerator</b> or <b>RunManager</b> class
has a function of generating
the relevant interaction/decay matrix objects
and running a given primary particle, which has a main
method for you to create Monte Carlo events.
The probability table for the Monte Carlo method
to determine the path length and the recoiling energy
is generated by <b>InteractionsBase</b> class
in the interaction package and by <b>MuDecayBase/TauDecayBase</b>
class in the decay package, both of which inherits
<b>MonteCarloBase</b> abstract class in this package.
They also have the methods to sample the path length
and the recoiling energy as a function of primary energy
and interaction/decay channel for the Event Class.

<P>
<b>RunManager</b> outputs the calculated results in form
of the matrix called Event Matrix. It basically supplied
a probability of amount of energy deposit 
(energies of electromagnetic and/or hadron cascades,
in other way) during the propagation
as a function of primary energy. <b>JulietEventGenerator</b>
generates events which consist of lists of energy deposit
but also takes into account the IceCube and the Earth geometry
provided the classes in the iceCube.uhe.geometry package.
<b>RunJuliet.java</b> has a main method to run 
<b>JulietEventGenerator</b>. 
<b>EventFlux</b> class
then multiplies them with the matrices calculated
by <b>PropagationNeutrinoFlux</b> in the neutrino model
package to give neutrino/muon/tau intensities as a function
of amount of energy deposit. 

<p>
<b>RunJuliet.cxx</b> is the JNI program to invoke
<b>JulietEventGenerator</b> from C++ side. It has a small
main method to run itself for showing how to use it.
This is a seed program for porting JULIeT in the IceTray
environment.

<p>
<b>SwingRun</b> class provides a java Swing-based GUI
to generate the Monte Carlo events. The events are
formed and traced by <b>JulietTask</b> and displayed
by <b>ParticleTravelGraphics</b>.
